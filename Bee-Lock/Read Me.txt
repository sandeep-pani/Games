
Thank You for downloading the game.

Install the game by opening the setup file. 
Obviously this game is not proffesionally made so it has a very high scope of improvement.
Cut me some slack by not critiquing every frame of the game.
Also, this game is really hard to beat, but it should take only about 30 seconds of your time to beat it.
I would like to add, this game isn't completely original, the soul idea is taken from a youtube channel called 'Brackeys', 
whose tutorials I followed for making it since this is my first ever game.
But I have added a variety of different elements of my own to make the game look closer to an original one. 

I hope you enjoy the game.
